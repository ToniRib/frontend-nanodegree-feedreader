# Project Overview

In this project, Udacity provided a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The project was to use [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine), a JavaScript test suite maintained by Pivotal Labs, to write tests for the basic functionality of the app.

## Included Tests
Tests include the following (as part of the feedreader.js file):
- RSS Feeds
	- are defined
	- each feed has a URL defined
	- each feed has a name defined
- The menu
	- is hidden by default
	- changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked
- Initial Entries
	- has at least one entry in the feed container
- New Feed Selection
	- changes content when a new feed is selected

## Running the App
You can run the app by opening the index.html file in your browser. At the bottom of the page, the Jasmine specs are displayed. If the tests are written correctly, there should be 7 specs with 0 failures.

You can use the hamburger icon on the left side of the app to navigate to the different feeds provided.
